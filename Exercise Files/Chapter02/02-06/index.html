    <h1>Avery Washington</h1>
    <p>SAMOCA presents a collection of paintings by Avery Washington,described by Art World as "the pre-eminent American post-painterly abstractionist, rejecting Rothko's mantle and running to the edges of color field theory." This exhibit includes work shown at the Gauggossian (NYC), MoMA, and Greene & Stromberg, and several paintings making their debut at SAMOCA.</p>
